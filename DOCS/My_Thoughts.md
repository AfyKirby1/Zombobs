## 2025-01-22 - V0.7.2 ALPHA Major Update

Just completed the V0.7.2 ALPHA release, which includes several major improvements and new features. This update focuses on improving the multiplayer experience, backend infrastructure, and game balance.

**MongoDB Migration** was a critical infrastructure improvement. Moving from file-based storage to MongoDB Atlas ensures that highscores persist across server restarts on Hugging Face Spaces. The graceful fallback system means the server continues to work even if MongoDB is unavailable, which is important for reliability. The async database operations prevent blocking, so API responses remain fast.

**Multiplayer Lobby Chat System** adds much-needed communication between players. The glassmorphism-styled chat window fits perfectly with the game's aesthetic. Security was a priority - rate limiting (5 messages per 10 seconds), HTML entity encoding for XSS prevention, and server-side validation ensure the chat system is safe. The circular buffer storage keeps memory usage fixed, which is important for long-running servers.

**Game Over Screen Improvements** make navigation much smoother. The "Back to Lobby" and "Back to Main Menu" buttons provide clear navigation options, and fixing the cursor/hover state issues makes the interface feel more polished. The bug fix for the pause screen appearing on multiplayer game start was important for a smooth experience.

**Main Menu Layout Improvements** reorganize the UI for better visibility. Moving the username box to the top, repositioning the global leaderboard, and simplifying the last run display creates a cleaner, more organized interface.

**XP System Balance Adjustments** address player feedback about progression feeling too fast. The 10% XP reduction and switch to linear progression (from exponential) makes each level-up feel more meaningful. The XP bar reset fix ensures the UI correctly shows progress.

Overall, this update significantly improves the multiplayer experience and backend reliability. The MongoDB migration ensures data persistence, the chat system enables better player communication, and the various bug fixes and UI improvements make the game feel more polished.

## 2025-01-21 - V0.7.1.1 ALPHA Bug Fix

Quick patch release to fix a critical syntax error that was preventing the game from running. The duplicate `zombieType` declaration in `combatUtils.js` was a simple oversight that caused a runtime error. Also took the opportunity to fix the Docker configuration for the Hugging Face Space deployment and update all version references to V0.7.1.1 ALPHA.

The bug fix was straightforward - just removing the duplicate variable declaration. The Docker configuration fix ensures the server files are correctly referenced when building the container image. All version indicators have been updated consistently across the project.

## 2025-01-21 - V0.7.1 Polish Update

Just completed the V0.7.1 polish update focused on enhancing player feedback and quality-of-life improvements. This was a great opportunity to add those "nice to have" features that make the game feel more polished and responsive.

**Enhanced Kill Feedback** was the biggest win. The varying kill sounds by zombie type add so much character - hearing a higher-pitched "pop" for fast zombies vs a deep "thud" for bosses gives immediate audio feedback about what you just killed. The enhanced streak visuals are also much more satisfying - seeing "LEGENDARY STREAK!" in gold at 20+ kills feels like a real achievement.

**Multi-kill detection** was a fun addition. Tracking kills within a 500ms window and showing "MULTI KILL!" or "MEGA KILL!" adds that arcade-style satisfaction when you clear a group quickly. The magenta color makes it stand out from regular combo text.

**Quick Stats on Game Over** provides immediate feedback about the session. The card-based layout is clean and the record notifications give that dopamine hit when you break a personal best. It's a small thing but makes the game over screen feel more informative and rewarding.

**Weapon Switch Animation** is subtle but effective. The 150ms flash gives just enough feedback to confirm the weapon change without being distracting. Only showing it for the local player keeps it clean in multiplayer.

**Pickup Visibility** improvements were needed. In chaotic moments, pickups can be hard to spot. The enhanced pulse and glow, especially for rare pickups, makes them much more noticeable. The double glow rings for Nuke and Damage Buff really make them stand out.

**Settings Tab Memory** is a small QoL improvement that saves a click every time you open settings. Simple localStorage persistence, but it adds up over time.

All features follow KISS, DOTI, and YAGNI principles - no over-engineering, just practical improvements that enhance the player experience. The update feels cohesive and focused on polish rather than adding new systems.

## 2025-01-21 - Engine Performance Micro-Optimizations

Just completed 15 small performance optimizations to squeeze out extra performance from the engine. These are the "tiny improvements" that add up:

1. **Math.sqrt() Elimination** - Replaced 26+ expensive sqrt calls with squared distance comparisons. Only calculate sqrt when we actually need the distance value (normalization, damage falloff).

2. **forEach() to for Loops** - Converted hot-path iterations to faster for loops. Small but measurable improvement.

3. **Quadtree Reuse** - The Quadtree was being recreated every frame. Now it's reused and just cleared/updated. Reduces GC pressure.

4. **Query Range Reuse** - Same idea - reuse the query range object instead of creating new ones per bullet.

5. **Settings Caching** - Cache frequently accessed settings at frame start. Reduces repeated property lookups.

6. **Viewport Caching** - Calculate viewport bounds once per frame, reuse everywhere.

7. **Property Caching** - Cache object properties in local variables within loops.

8. **Early Returns** - Skip processing for entities that don't need it (dead, expired, off-screen).

9. **Math Constants** - Added TWO_PI constant to avoid repeated Math.PI * 2 calculations.

These are all small wins individually, but together they should provide 5-15% additional FPS improvement, especially on low-end hardware. The optimizations focus on hot paths: collision detection, distance calculations, and rendering loops.

All changes maintain code readability and pass linting. Following KISS, DOTI, and YAGNI principles - no over-engineering, just practical improvements.

# My Thoughts

## Current State [2025-11-20]

The project is currently at **V0.7.0**. News reel has been moved to the bottom of the screen with improved visibility and updated content. Previous version (V0.6.0) included major balance overhaul with crit rate reduction, doubled zombie HP (except Boss), doubled weapon damage, and Hoarder skill bug fix. We've successfully implemented a robust multiplayer lobby synchronization system that ensures all players enter the game simultaneously in the same session.

### Recent Fixes
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved `Uncaught ReferenceError: MAX_GRENADES is not defined` in `main.js`.
  - `MAX_GRENADES` was used in the ammo pickup tooltip logic but was not imported from `constants.js`.
  - Added `MAX_GRENADES` to the named imports in `main.js`.
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved `TypeError: bullet.isOffScreen is not a function` in `main.js`.
  - The `Bullet` class uses `markedForRemoval` flag instead of an `isOffScreen` method.
  - Updated `main.js` to check `!bullet.markedForRemoval` consistent with the `Bullet` class implementation.
  - This ensures bullets are correctly cleaned up without crashing the game.

### Recent Achievements (V0.3.0 ALPHA & V0.3.1)

11. **HUD Polish**: Added UI indicators for all power-ups (Speed, Rapid Fire, Shield), ensuring players know exactly how long buffs last.

### Latest Achievement (V0.4.1)
- **Multiplayer Synchronization Fix**: Resolved critical issue where players were starting games in separate sessions
  - Implemented ready system: Players can toggle ready status before game starts
  - Leader system: First player is designated leader, can start game when all are ready
  - Synchronized start: Server validates leader status and all-ready state before broadcasting start to all clients
  - Enhanced UI: Lobby now shows leader indicator (👑) and ready status (✅/❌) for each player
  - Context-aware buttons: Leader sees "Start Game", non-leaders see "Ready"/"Unready"
  - Server-side validation: Ensures game only starts when valid (leader + all ready)
  - Automatic leader reassignment: If leader disconnects, new leader is automatically assigned
  - Comprehensive documentation: Created `DOCS/MULTIPLAYER.md` documenting the architecture

- **Main Menu News Ticker**: Added dynamic scrolling announcement bar
  - Displays version highlights from V0.4.0 and V0.4.1
  - Stateless animation using `Date.now()` for consistent behavior
  - Seamless looping with double-text rendering pattern
  - Amber/gold styling matches game's tech aesthetic
  - Positioned above footer area for visibility without intrusion

### Immediate Focus
- **Multiplayer Testing**: Verify synchronized game start works reliably with multiple clients
- **Error Handling**: Ensure graceful handling of edge cases (leader disconnect during start, etc.)
- **Network Stability**: Monitor connection stability and implement reconnection handling if needed
- **Local Co-op Polish**: Ensure controller assignment remains robust in edge cases (disconnects)
- **Asset Integration**: Successfully integrated texture-based ground rendering
- **Design System**: Established clear design guidelines for future UI work
- **Documentation Quality**: Maintained comprehensive documentation as project grows

### Thoughts on Architecture
The transition to a multi-player `gameState` was smoother than expected thanks to the modular design. By keeping `gameState.player` as a compatibility getter for `gameState.players[0]`, we avoided rewriting hundreds of lines of single-player logic. The input system's ability to "lock" gamepads to specific players works well for preventing input conflicts.

The menu effects system (`GameHUD.drawCreepyBackground`) is a nice reusable pattern. We could potentially use similar overlay effects for "low health" or "nuke" events in the future.

### Next Actions
- **Boss Waves**: Introduce a "Boss" zombie type every 10 waves
- **Score Multiplier**: Implement a combo-based score multiplier visible in HUD
- **More Maps**: Add a map selection screen now that we have the tech for tile-based backgrounds
