# XP and Skills System Documentation

## Overview

The XP (Experience Points) and Skills System is a core progression mechanic in Zombobs that allows players to level up by defeating zombies and choose skills to enhance their combat effectiveness. The system features 16 unique skills, a 3-choice level-up selection screen, and exponential XP scaling.

## XP System

### XP Gain Sources

Players gain XP exclusively by **killing zombies**. The amount of XP awarded depends on the zombie type:

| Zombie Type | XP Awarded | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| Normal | 8 XP | Basic zombie, most common |
| Fast (Runner) | 15 XP | Faster movement speed |
| Exploding (Boomer) | 23 XP | Explodes on death, AOE damage |
| Armored (Tank) | 18 XP | Higher health, slower movement |
| Ghost | 27 XP | Can phase through obstacles |
| Spitter | 23 XP | Ranged acid projectile attacks |
| Boss | 375 XP | Large health pool, special abilities |

**Note**: XP values were increased by 1.5x from previous values to accelerate progression.

### XP Award Locations

XP is awarded in the following combat scenarios:

1. **Bullet Kills** (`js/utils/combatUtils.js` - `handleBulletZombieCollisions()`)
   - When a bullet collides with and kills a zombie
   - XP is awarded immediately upon zombie death

2. **Explosion Kills** (`js/utils/combatUtils.js` - `triggerExplosion()`)
   - When zombies are killed by explosion damage (grenades, exploding zombies)
   - XP is awarded for each zombie killed in the explosion radius

3. **Melee Kills** (`js/systems/MeleeSystem.js`)
   - When zombies are killed by melee attacks
   - XP is awarded on successful melee kill

### XP Rate Multiplier

The current XP rate is **1.5x** the base values, meaning players gain experience 50% faster than the original balanced progression. This was implemented to provide a more engaging leveling experience.

## Level-Up System

### Level Progression

Players start at **Level 1** with **0 XP**. Each level requires progressively more XP to reach the next level.

**XP Requirements Formula**:
```
nextLevelXP = baseXP × (scalingFactor ^ (level - 1))
```

**Constants**:
- `XP_BASE_REQUIREMENT = 100` (base XP for level 2)
- `XP_SCALING_FACTOR = 1.2` (20% increase per level)

**Example Progression**:
- Level 1 → 2: 100 XP
- Level 2 → 3: 120 XP (100 × 1.2¹)
- Level 3 → 4: 144 XP (100 × 1.2²)
- Level 4 → 5: 173 XP (100 × 1.2³)
- Level 5 → 6: 207 XP (100 × 1.2⁴)
- Level 10 → 11: 516 XP (100 × 1.2⁹)

### Level-Up Process

1. **XP Accumulation**: As players kill zombies, XP is added to `gameState.xp`
2. **Level Check**: Each time XP is gained, the system checks if `gameState.xp >= gameState.nextLevelXP`
3. **Level-Up Trigger**: When threshold is reached, `levelUp()` is called
4. **Skill Selection**: A 3-choice skill selection screen appears
5. **XP Reset**: XP is NOT reset to 0; it continues accumulating (allowing multiple level-ups if enough XP is gained)

### Level-Up UI

The level-up screen displays **3 skill choices** (expanded from the original 2). Players can:
- Click on any of the 3 skill cards to select that skill
- See skill icon, name, and description
- Skills are randomly selected from the available pool
- If skill slots are full (6 max), only upgrades to existing skills are offered

**Location**: `js/ui/GameHUD.js` - Level-up screen rendering

  - Additive effects (crit chance, lucky strike chance) stack additively
  - Boolean effects (regeneration, bloodlust, adrenaline) can stack (multiple instances)

### Skill Selection Logic

When leveling up, the system generates 3 random skill choices:

1. **If skill slots are available** (< 6 active skills):
   - All 16 skills are available for selection
   - Randomly selects 3 from the full pool

2. **If skill slots are full** (6 active skills):
   - Only upgrades to existing skills are offered
   - Randomly selects 3 from currently active skills

3. **Fallback**: If fewer than 3 choices are available, fills remaining slots with random skills from the pool

**Location**: `js/systems/SkillSystem.js` - `generateChoices()`

## Skill Effects Integration

Skills are integrated throughout the game systems. Here's where each skill effect is applied:

### Combat System (`js/utils/combatUtils.js`)

- **Thick Skin**: Applied in damage calculation when player takes damage
- **Lucky Strike**: Checked in bullet damage calculation, doubles damage on proc
- **Bloodlust**: Triggers on zombie kill, heals player 2 HP
- **Adrenaline**: Triggers on zombie kill, applies 20% speed boost for 3 seconds
- **Eagle Eye**: Critical hit chance checked in damage calculation

### Player Movement (`js/systems/PlayerSystem.js`)

- **Swift Steps**: `player.speedMultiplier` applied to base movement speed
- **Adrenaline**: Speed boost multiplier applied when `adrenalineBoostActive` is true
- **Regeneration**: Health regeneration processed in game loop (1 HP/sec)

### Weapon System (`js/utils/combatUtils.js` - `shootBullet()`)

- **Long Range**: `player.bulletRangeMultiplier` applied to bullet max distance
- **Steady Aim**: `player.bulletSpreadReduction` applied to bullet spread angle
- **Iron Grip / Fast Fingers**: `player.reloadSpeedMultiplier` applied to reload time
- **Quick Hands**: `player.weaponSwitchSpeedMultiplier` applied to weapon switch time
- **Hoarder**: `player.ammoMultiplier` applied to max ammo capacity

### Pickup System (`js/systems/PickupSpawnSystem.js`)

- **Scavenger**: `player.pickupSpawnRateMultiplier` applied to all pickup spawn chance calculations

### Shield System

- **Armor Plating**: Directly adds shield points to `player.shield` (capped at 100)

---

## Multiplayer Synchronization

### Leader-Client Architecture

In multiplayer (co-op) mode, the **leader** (host) controls XP and skill selection:

1. **XP Gain**: Only the leader awards XP and broadcasts it to clients via `game:xp` event
2. **Level-Up**: Leader generates skill choices and broadcasts level-up data via `game:levelup` event
3. **Skill Selection**: Leader broadcasts chosen skill via `game:skill` event
4. **Client Sync**: Clients receive XP, level-up data, and skill choices, then apply them locally

### Network Events

- `game:xp` - Broadcasts XP amount to all clients
- `game:levelup` - Broadcasts level, nextLevelXP, and skill choices
- `game:skill` - Broadcasts selected skill ID

**Location**: `js/systems/MultiplayerSystem.js`

    ↓
Checks if gameState.xp >= gameState.nextLevelXP
    ↓
If true: SkillSystem.levelUp() is called
    ↓
Level increments, nextLevelXP recalculated
    ↓
3 skill choices generated
    ↓
Level-up screen displayed (gameState.showLevelUp = true)
    ↓

## Balance Notes

### XP Rate History

- **Original Values**: Normal: 10, Fast: 20, Exploding: 30, Armored: 25, Ghost: 35, Spitter: 30, Boss: 500
- **Balanced Values** (50% reduction): Normal: 5, Fast: 10, Exploding: 15, Armored: 12, Ghost: 18, Spitter: 15, Boss: 250
- **Current Values** (1.5x increase): Normal: 8, Fast: 15, Exploding: 23, Armored: 18, Ghost: 27, Spitter: 23, Boss: 375

The current 1.5x multiplier provides a faster progression rate while maintaining meaningful level-up milestones.

### Skill Balance

- **Multiplicative Skills**: Stack multiplicatively to prevent exponential power growth
- **Additive Skills**: Stack additively for predictable scaling
- **Max Slots**: 6-skill limit prevents players from becoming overpowered
- **Upgrade System**: Allows players to specialize in preferred skills

## Future Considerations

Potential enhancements to the XP and Skills System:

1. **XP Bonuses**: Kill streak multipliers, wave completion bonuses
2. **Skill Synergies**: Special effects when certain skill combinations are active
3. **Skill Rarities**: Common, rare, epic skill tiers with varying power levels
4. **Prestige System**: Reset levels for permanent bonuses
5. **Skill Trees**: Branching skill paths instead of random selection
6. **XP Display**: Show XP gain numbers when zombies are killed

---

## Summary

The XP and Skills System provides a rewarding progression loop where players:
1. Kill zombies to gain XP
2. Level up to unlock skill choices
3. Select skills to enhance their playstyle
4. Upgrade skills for increased effectiveness
5. Build powerful skill combinations

The system is fully integrated across combat, movement, weapons, and pickups, ensuring skills feel impactful and meaningful throughout gameplay.
