  - Server validates: 1) Requester is leader, 2) All players are ready
  - Server broadcasts `game:start` to all clients simultaneously
  - All clients receive signal and start game together in same session
  - Error handling: Server sends `game:start:error` if validation fails
  
- ✅ **Enhanced Lobby UI**: Improved player list display and button logic
  - Shows leader crown (👑) next to leader's name
  - Shows ready status (✅ Ready / ❌ Not Ready) for each player

  - `gameState.multiplayer.isReady` - Tracks local player ready status
  - State automatically synced from server on every `lobby:update` event
  - UI updates reactively based on state changes
  
- ✅ **Documentation**: Created comprehensive multiplayer architecture guide
  - New file: `DOCS/MULTIPLAYER.md`
  - Documents server/client architecture, packet flow, synchronization guarantees
  - Includes error handling patterns and future enhancement notes

### Critical Bug Fixes [2025-11-20]
- ✅ **Grenade Limit Bug**: Fixed `Uncaught ReferenceError: MAX_GRENADES is not defined` in `main.js`.
