## Rank System

### Overview

The Rank System tracks permanent player progression through military-style ranks. Players accumulate Rank XP across all game sessions, separate from in-game XP which resets each game.

### Rank Progression

**Rank Structure**:
- 9 Ranks: Private → Corporal → Sergeant → Lieutenant → Captain → Major → Colonel → General → Legend
- 5 Tiers per rank (e.g., Private I, Private II, Private III, Private IV, Private V)
- Exponential XP scaling similar to in-game levels

**Rank Names**:
1. Private
2. Corporal
3. Sergeant
4. Lieutenant
5. Captain
6. Major
7. Colonel
8. General
9. Legend

### Rank XP Sources

**Session Score Conversion**:
- Default: 1 score = 0.1 rank XP (configurable via `SCORE_TO_RANK_XP_RATE`)
- Example: 1000 score = 100 rank XP

**Wave Completion Bonuses**:
- 10 rank XP per wave completed
- Encourages players to survive longer

**Achievement Rewards**:
- Achievements can award rank XP bonuses (typically 100-10,000 XP)
- Major achievements provide significant rank progression

**Battlepass Challenges**:
- Daily/weekly challenges can award rank XP
- Seasonal challenges provide large rank XP rewards

### Rank XP Requirements

**Formula**:
```
nextTierXP = baseXP × (scalingFactor ^ totalTiers)
```

**Constants**:
- `RANK_XP_BASE_REQUIREMENT = 100` (base XP for first tier of first rank)
- `RANK_XP_SCALING_FACTOR = 1.15` (15% increase per tier)

**Example Progression**:
- Private I → II: 100 XP
- Private II → III: 115 XP (100 × 1.15¹)
- Private III → IV: 132 XP (100 × 1.15²)
- Private V → Corporal I: 201 XP (100 × 1.15⁴)
- Total for Private rank: ~674 XP
- Total for Corporal rank: ~1,160 XP

### Rank Display

- Shows current rank name and tier
- Optional rank badge in HUD (future feature)
