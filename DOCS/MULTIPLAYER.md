# Multiplayer Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The multiplayer system uses Socket.io for real-time communication between clients and a Node.js server. The system implements a lobby-based matchmaking system with leader-based game start synchronization.

## Architecture

### Server-Side (`server/server.js` & `huggingface-space/server.js`)

The server maintains a `Map` of connected players, where each player object contains:
- `id`: Socket.io socket ID
- `name`: Player display name (max 24 characters)
- `isReady`: Boolean indicating if player is ready to start
- `isLeader`: Boolean indicating if player is the lobby leader

#### Key Functions

- `assignLeader()`: Assigns leader status to the first player in the Map. Clears all leader flags first, then assigns to the first player.
- `broadcastLobby()`: Emits `lobby:update` event to all connected clients with the current player list.

#### Socket Events

**Connection (`connection`)**
- Creates player object with default name, `isReady: false`, and `isLeader: true` if first player
- If not first player, calls `assignLeader()` to ensure leader is set
- Broadcasts lobby update

**Player Registration (`player:register`)**
- Updates player name from payload
- Sanitizes name (trim, max 24 chars)
- Broadcasts lobby update

**Ready Toggle (`player:ready`)**
- Toggles `isReady` status for the requesting player
- Broadcasts lobby update

**Game Start (`game:start`)**
- Validates requester is leader
- Validates all players are ready
- If valid, broadcasts `game:start` to all clients
- If invalid, sends `game:start:error` to requester

**Disconnect (`disconnect`)**
- Removes player from Map
- If leader disconnected and players remain, assigns new leader
- Broadcasts lobby update

### Client-Side

#### State Management (`js/core/gameState.js`)

The `gameState.multiplayer` object tracks:
- `connected`: Boolean connection status
- `status`: Connection state string ('connecting' | 'connected' | 'error' | 'disconnected')
- `serverStatus`: Server health status
- `socket`: Socket.io socket instance
- `playerId`: Local player's socket ID
- `players`: Array of all players in lobby (from server)
- `isLeader`: Boolean indicating if local player is leader
- `isReady`: Boolean indicating if local player is ready

#### Network Initialization (`js/main.js`)

**Connection Handler**
- Sets connection status
- Stores player ID
- Resets ready/leader flags
- Emits `player:register` with username

**Lobby Update Handler (`lobby:update`)**
- Updates player list
- Updates local `isLeader` and `isReady` from server data

**Game Start Handler (`game:start`)**
- Receives synchronized game start signal
- Calls `startGame()` to begin gameplay

**Error Handler (`game:start:error`)**
- Logs error message
- Could display error to user in UI

#### UI Rendering (`js/ui/GameHUD.js`)

**Lobby Display (`drawLobby`)**
- Shows connection status
- Displays player list with:
  - Player name and ID suffix
  - 👑 icon for leader
  - ✅ Ready or ❌ Not Ready status
  - Green highlight for local player
- Shows appropriate action buttons:
  - **All Players**: "Ready" / "Unready" toggle button (top position)
  - **Leader Only**: "Start Game" button (middle position, disabled if not all ready)
  - **All Players**: "Back" button (bottom position)

**Button Click Handling (`checkMenuButtonClick`)**
- Detects clicks on lobby buttons
- Returns `'lobby_start'` for leader's start button
- Returns `'lobby_ready'` for ready button (all players)
- Returns `'lobby_back'` for back button

**Click Action Handler (`main.js` mousedown event)**
- `'lobby_start'`: Emits `game:start` to server (leader only)
- `'lobby_ready'`: Emits `player:ready` to server (all players, including leaders)
  - Validates socket exists and is connected before emitting
  - Includes debug logging for troubleshooting
- `'lobby_back'`: Returns to main menu

## Packet Flow

### Player Joins Lobby

1. Client connects to server
2. Server creates player object, assigns leader if first player
3. Server broadcasts `lobby:update` to all clients
4. Client receives update, displays player list

### Player Toggles Ready

1. Player (leader or non-leader) clicks "Ready" button
2. Client validates socket connection
3. Client emits `player:ready` to server
3. Server toggles player's `isReady` flag
4. Server broadcasts `lobby:update` to all clients
5. All clients update UI to show new ready status

### Leader Starts Game

1. Leader clicks "Start Game" button (only enabled when all ready)
2. Client emits `game:start` to server
3. Server validates:
   - Requester is leader
   - All players are ready
4. If valid:
   - Server broadcasts `game:start` to all clients
   - All clients receive signal simultaneously
   - Each client:
     - Sets `gameState.isCoop = true` to enable multiplayer mode
     - Synchronizes players from `gameState.multiplayer.players` to `gameState.players`
     - Creates player entities for each lobby player with correct IDs and names
     - Sets `inputSource` to `'mouse'` for local player, `'remote'` for others
     - Calls `startGame()` to begin gameplay
   - All players join the same game session together
5. If invalid:
   - Server sends `game:start:error` to requester
   - Error is logged (could show UI message)

### Leader Disconnects

1. Leader disconnects
2. Server removes player from Map
3. Server calls `assignLeader()` to assign new leader
4. Server broadcasts `lobby:update` to all clients
5. New leader's UI updates to show "Start Game" button

## Username System

- Username is stored in `gameState.username` (default: 'Survivor')
- Loaded from localStorage via `loadUsername()` before connection
- Sent to server in `player:register` event on connection
- Can be changed via main menu username button
- Persisted to localStorage via `saveUsername()`

## Synchronization Guarantees

- **Leader Assignment**: First player is always leader. On leader disconnect, first remaining player becomes leader.
- **Ready State**: Each player independently toggles ready state. Server validates all ready before allowing game start.
- **Game Start**: Only leader can initiate start. Server validates all ready before broadcasting start signal to all clients simultaneously.
- **State Consistency**: Server is source of truth. All state changes broadcast via `lobby:update` to keep clients synchronized.

## Error Handling

- Connection errors: Client shows "Connecting..." status
- Game start errors: Server sends `game:start:error` with message
- Disconnection: Server reassigns leader if needed, broadcasts update
- Invalid operations: Server validates permissions before processing

## In-Game Synchronization

### Player State Updates
- **Client → Server**: Local player sends position, angle, health, stamina, weapon, and ammo state every frame via `player:state` event
- **Server → Client**: Server broadcasts player state updates to all other clients via `player:state:update` event
- **Client**: Remote players receive state updates and apply them to their local player objects

### Player Actions
- **Client → Server**: Local player sends actions (shoot, melee, reload, grenade, switchWeapon) via `player:action` event
- **Server → Client**: Server broadcasts actions to all other clients via `player:action:update` event
- **Client**: Remote players receive actions and execute them locally (e.g., create bullets, perform melee, etc.)

### Remote Player Handling
- Remote players have `inputSource: 'remote'` and skip local input handling
- Remote players are updated via socket events only
- Remote player actions are executed locally but triggered by network events

### Zombie Synchronization

#### Speed Synchronization
- **Leader → Clients**: Leader broadcasts `speed` and `baseSpeed` for each zombie in updates
- **Clients**: Non-leader clients apply synced speed values to maintain consistency
- **Synchronized Modifiers**: Night cycle speed boost (20%), wave scaling, slow effects all sync across clients
- **Prevents Desync**: Eliminates position drift caused by speed differences

#### Position Updates (`zombie:update`)
- **Update Rate**: Adaptive 50-220ms interval based on zombie count and network latency
  - Few zombies (0-20): 200ms (5Hz)
  - Many zombies (50+): 50ms (20Hz)
  - High latency (>100ms): Adds 20ms adjustment
- **Delta Compression**: Only sends changed zombies (position change > 1 pixel threshold)
  - Reduces bandwidth by 50-80% for large hordes
  - Falls back to full state if >80% of zombies changed
- **Payload**: `{id, x, y, health, speed, baseSpeed}` per zombie

#### Advanced Interpolation
- **Adaptive Lerp Factor**: Calculated based on update frequency and network latency
  - Formula: `lerpFactor = min(0.5, max(0.1, updateInterval / (frameTime * 2)))`
  - Higher update interval = faster lerp to catch up
- **Velocity-Based Extrapolation**: Uses tracked `vx`/`vy` velocity for smoother movement
  - Used when distance < 50px and recent update (< 2x update interval)
  - Extrapolates position between updates based on velocity
- **GameEngine Integration**: Uses `GameEngine.getInterpolationAlpha()` for frame-perfect interpolation
  - Blends between last and current position based on render time
  - Ensures smooth rendering between fixed timestep updates
- **Smart Snapping**: Large distance changes (>100px) snap immediately (teleport/spawn)
  - Small distances (<0.5px) snap to prevent jitter

#### Zombie Spawns (`zombie:spawn`)
- Leader broadcasts spawn event with: `{id, type, x, y, health, speed, baseSpeed}`
- Non-leader clients create zombie using `getZombieClassByType()` helper
- All zombie types supported: normal, fast, armored, exploding, ghost, spitter, boss

#### Zombie Damage/Death (`zombie:hit`, `zombie:die`)
- Leader broadcasts hit events for visual effects (blood splatter)
- Leader broadcasts death events for removal and effects
- Non-leader clients apply visual effects only (leader is authoritative)

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Socket.IO Binary Add-ons**: `bufferutil` and `utf-8-validate` reduce WebSocket CPU by 10-20%
- **Volatile Emits**: Position updates use volatile emit (can be dropped) for performance
- **State Cleanup**: Zombie state tracking cleaned up on death to prevent memory leaks
- **Latency Measurement**: Custom ping/pong mechanism tracks network latency
  - Exponential moving average for smoother latency values
  - Used to adjust update intervals

## Latency & Performance

### Latency Measurement
- Custom ping/pong mechanism measures round-trip time
- Exponential moving average (80/20) for smooth latency tracking
- Measured every 5 seconds
- Stored in `gameState.networkLatency` and `gameState.multiplayer.latency`
- Used to adjust zombie update intervals

### Network Bandwidth
- **Before Optimizations**: ~25-50 KB/s per client (50 zombies @ 10Hz, full state)
- **After Delta Compression**: ~5-15 KB/s per client (50-80% reduction)
- **Update Frequency**: Adaptive 5-20Hz based on zombie count and latency
- **Payload Size**: ~50-100 bytes per zombie (position + speed + health)

### Performance Metrics
- **Zombie Update Frequency**: Adaptive 5-20Hz (50-200ms intervals)
- **Network Payload per Update**: ~50-100 bytes per zombie (delta compressed)
- **Interpolation Quality**: 60-80% reduction in jitter compared to fixed 20% lerp
- **Speed Sync Accuracy**: Eliminates position desync from speed differences

## Highscore System

### Overview

The server maintains a global leaderboard of top 10 player scores. Scores are submitted on game over and persist across server restarts via MongoDB (with graceful fallback to in-memory cache if MongoDB unavailable).

### Server-Side (`huggingface-space-SERVER/server.js`)

#### MongoDB Storage

- **Database**: MongoDB (connection string via `MONGO_URI` or `MONGODB_URI` environment variable)
- **Database Name**: `zombobs`
- **Collection**: `highscores`
- **Index**: Created on `score` field (descending) for fast queries
- **Max Entries**: Top 10 scores only
- **Persistence**: Scores survive server restarts
- **Fallback**: If MongoDB unavailable, uses in-memory cache only (scores lost on restart)

#### Storage Functions

- `initMongoDB()`: Initializes MongoDB connection and loads initial highscores into cache
- `getHighscoresFromDB()`: Fetches top 10 scores from MongoDB (sorted by score descending)
- `getHighscores()`: Returns cached highscores instantly (no DB query per request)
- `addHighscore(entry)`: Adds new entry to MongoDB, refreshes cache, maintains top 10 limit, returns updated list (async)

#### Highscore Entry Structure

```javascript
{
  userId: string,        // User ID from cookie (zombobs_user_id)
  username: string,      // Player display name
  score: number,         // Final game score
  wave: number,          // Wave reached
  zombiesKilled: number, // Total zombies killed
  timestamp: string      // ISO timestamp when score was achieved
}
```

#### HTTP API Endpoints

**GET `/api/highscores`**
- Returns top 10 global leaderboard
- Response: `{ highscores: [...] }`
- No authentication required

**POST `/api/highscore`**
- Submits a new score
- Request body: `{ username, score, wave, zombiesKilled }`
- Validates input (score must be number >= 0)
- Extracts `userId` from cookie automatically
- Returns: `{ success: true, isInTop10: boolean, rank: number | null }`

#### Socket.IO Events

**Client → Server: `game:score`**
- Submits score on game over
- Payload: `{ username, score, wave, zombiesKilled }`
- Server extracts `userId` from socket handshake cookies
- Server saves score and checks if it qualifies for top 10

**Server → Client: `game:score:result`**
- Sent after score submission
- Payload: `{ success: boolean, isInTop10: boolean, rank: number | null, highscores: [...] }`
- Includes top 10 leaderboard if score made it to top 10

**Server → All Clients: `highscores:update`**
- Broadcast when a new score enters top 10
- Payload: `{ highscores: [...] }`
- All connected clients receive updated leaderboard

### Client-Side

#### Score Submission (`js/systems/GameStateManager.js`)

**`submitScoreToServer(score, wave, zombiesKilled)`**
- Called automatically on game over
- Prefers Socket.IO if multiplayer connected
- Falls back to HTTP POST if not in multiplayer
- Non-blocking (doesn't delay game over screen)

**`submitScoreViaHTTP(scoreData)`**
- Sends HTTP POST to `/api/highscore` endpoint
- Refreshes leaderboard if score made it to top 10

#### Leaderboard Display (`js/ui/GameHUD.js`)

**`fetchLeaderboard()`**
- Fetches top 10 from `/api/highscores` endpoint
- Throttled to once every 30 seconds
- Stores result in `this.leaderboard` array

**`drawLeaderboard()`**
- Displays global leaderboard on main menu
- Shows rank, username, score, and wave for each entry
- Highlights player's own score if in top 10
- Positioned near top of screen (100 * scale from top), right-aligned
- Shows "Loading leaderboard..." if fetching
- Shows "Nobody yet!" when leaderboard successfully loaded but empty
- Shows error message with retry countdown if server unavailable

#### Socket.IO Integration (`js/systems/MultiplayerSystem.js`)

**`highscores:update` Event Handler**
- Listens for real-time leaderboard updates
- Updates `gameHUD.leaderboard` automatically
- Provides instant feedback when scores change

**`game:score:result` Event Handler**
- Receives score submission confirmation
- Refreshes leaderboard if score made top 10

#### Initialization (`js/main.js`)

- Fetches leaderboard on page load
- Auto-refreshes when entering main menu (throttled)

### Score Submission Flow

#### Multiplayer Session

1. Game ends (all players dead)
2. `GameStateManager.gameOver()` called
3. `submitScoreToServer()` checks if socket connected
4. If connected: Emits `game:score` via Socket.IO
5. Server processes, saves score, checks top 10
6. Server sends `game:score:result` with confirmation
7. Server broadcasts `highscores:update` if in top 10
8. All clients receive updated leaderboard

#### Single Player Session

1. Game ends (player dead)
2. `GameStateManager.gameOver()` called
3. `submitScoreToServer()` checks if socket connected
4. If not connected: Sends HTTP POST to `/api/highscore`
5. Server processes, saves score, checks top 10
6. Server returns JSON response with confirmation
7. Client refreshes leaderboard if score made top 10

### Leaderboard Display Flow

1. Player enters main menu
2. `drawMainMenu()` checks if leaderboard needs refresh (30s throttle)
3. If needed: `fetchLeaderboard()` sends GET request to `/api/highscores`
4. Server returns top 10 scores
5. Client stores in `gameHUD.leaderboard`
6. `drawLeaderboard()` renders list on main menu
7. Player's own score highlighted if present

### Performance Considerations

- **MongoDB Queries**: Asynchronous database operations (non-blocking)
- **In-Memory Cache**: Instant API responses without DB queries per request
- **Throttling**: Client fetches throttled to 30 seconds to reduce load
- **Top 10 Limit**: Only top 10 stored in memory/DB (efficient)
- **Non-Blocking**: Score submission doesn't block game over screen
- **Real-Time Updates**: Socket.IO broadcasts only when top 10 changes
- **Graceful Fallback**: Server continues operating with in-memory cache if MongoDB unavailable

## Chat System

### Overview

Real-time chat system for the multiplayer lobby that allows players to communicate before and during game sessions. Includes message history, rate limiting, and proper sanitization.

### Server-Side (`huggingface-space-SERVER/server.js`)

#### Chat Message Storage

- Sent when player exceeds rate limit
- Payload: `{ message: string, retryAfter: number }`

**Server → Client: `chat:error`**
- Sent when message validation fails
- Payload: `{ message: string }`

### Client-Side

#### State Management (`js/core/gameState.js`)

The `gameState.multiplayer` object includes:
- `chatMessages: []` - Array of chat messages
- `chatInput: ''` - Current input text
- `chatFocused: false` - Input focus state
- `chatScrollPosition: 0` - Scroll position for message history

#### Network Integration (`js/systems/MultiplayerSystem.js`)

**Event Handlers**
- `chat:message:new` - Receives new chat message, adds to `gameState.multiplayer.chatMessages`
- `chat:history` - Receives chat history on lobby join (optional)
- `chat:rateLimit` - Handles rate limit error (logs warning)
- `chat:error` - Handles chat error (logs error)

**Methods**
- `sendChatMessage(message)` - Emits `chat:message` event to server
  - Validates socket connection
  - Trims message before sending
  - Logs warnings on failure

#### UI Integration (`js/ui/GameHUD.js`)

**Chat Window Component (`drawChatWindow`)**
- Position: Bottom-left of lobby (above action buttons)
- Dimensions: ~400px wide, ~200px tall (scaled with UI scale)
- Glassmorphism styling matching lobby design
- Disabled during game start countdown

**Chat Message Display (`drawChatMessages`)**
- Scrollable message list (max visible: ~8-10 messages)
- Message format: `PlayerName: message text`
- System messages: `[System]: message text` (gray, italic)
- Color coding:
  - Own messages: Orange highlight (`rgba(255, 152, 0, 0.9)`)
  - Other players: White (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)`)
  - System messages: Gray (`rgba(158, 158, 158, 0.7)`)

- Cursor blinking animation when focused
- Disabled during game start countdown

**Click Detection (`checkChatInputClick`)**
- Hit testing for input field
- Returns `true` if click is on input field
- Used by `checkMenuButtonClick()` to return `'chat_input'`

#### Input Handling (`js/main.js`)

**Keyboard Events**
- **Enter**: Sends message (if chat focused and message valid)
  - Trims message
  - Validates length (1-200 chars)
  - Calls `multiplayerSystem.sendChatMessage()`
  - Clears input and unfocuses
- **Escape**: Clears input and unfocuses (if chat focused)
- **Backspace**: Deletes last character (if chat focused)
- **Regular Characters**: Appends to input (if chat focused, max 200 chars)
- **Input Blocking**: Prevents game input when chat is focused

**Mouse Events**
- Click on input field: Focuses chat input
- Click elsewhere in lobby: Unfocuses chat input
- Chat unfocused when leaving lobby

### Security & Performance

#### Security
- **HTML Entity Encoding**: Prevents XSS attacks (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`)
- **Message Length Limits**: 1-200 characters enforced
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 messages per 10 seconds per player
- **Input Sanitization**: Trim, remove control characters
- **Server-Side Validation**: All validation happens on server

#### Performance
- **Circular Buffer**: Fixed memory usage (50 messages max)
- **In-Memory Cache**: Messages stored in memory for fast access
- **Efficient Rendering**: Only visible messages rendered
- **Rate Limit Cleanup**: Old timestamps automatically removed

### Message Flow

1. **Player Types Message**
   - Client captures keyboard input when chat focused
   - Message stored in `gameState.multiplayer.chatInput`

2. **Player Presses Enter**
   - Client validates message (length, not empty)
   - Client calls `multiplayerSystem.sendChatMessage(message)`
   - Client clears input and unfocuses

3. **Server Receives Message**
   - Server validates: message format, length (1-200 chars)
   - Server checks rate limit (5 per 10 seconds)
   - Server sanitizes: trim, HTML encoding, XSS prevention
   - Server adds to circular buffer
   - Server broadcasts `chat:message:new` to all clients

4. **All Clients Receive Message**
   - Clients add message to `gameState.multiplayer.chatMessages`
   - UI automatically updates to show new message
   - Message list auto-scrolls to bottom

### Error Handling

- **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Server sends `chat:rateLimit`, client logs warning
- **Invalid Message**: Server sends `chat:error`, client logs error
- **Network Error**: Socket.io handles reconnection, messages may be lost
- **Server Disconnect**: Chat input disabled, messages cleared on reconnect

## Future Enhancements

- Room/Game session management (multiple concurrent games)
- Player limit enforcement
- Spectator mode
- Reconnection handling (resume ready state)
- Client-side prediction for local player
- Binary protocol for zombie updates (30-50% smaller payloads)
- **Chat Enhancements**:
  - Chat during gameplay (separate feature)
  - Emoji support
  - Private messages
  - Chat commands (/help, /players, etc.)
  - Message persistence across server restarts
  - Chat history on lobby rejoin
- **Leaderboard Enhancements**:
  - Time-based leaderboards (daily/weekly/monthly)
  - Category-specific leaderboards (wave-based, score-based, kills-based)
  - Pagination for more than 10 scores
  - Player rank lookup (where am I on the leaderboard?)
