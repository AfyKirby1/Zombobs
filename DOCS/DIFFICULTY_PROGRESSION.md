# Difficulty Progression Analysis

## Overview

The game uses a **wave-based difficulty system** with three main scaling factors:
1. **Zombie Count** - Linear increase per wave
2. **Zombie Speed** - Linear increase per wave  
3. **Zombie Health** - Step increase every 3 waves

Additionally, the game features **special zombie variants** that spawn at specific wave thresholds, each with unique health modifiers, speed multipliers, and special abilities. **Boss zombies** appear every 5 waves with massive health pools that scale with wave number.

## Scaling Formulas

### Zombie Count
```javascript
zombiesPerWave = 5 + (wave - 1) * 2
```
- **Wave 1**: 5 zombies
- **Wave 2**: 7 zombies (+2)
- **Wave 3**: 9 zombies (+2)
- **Wave 4**: 11 zombies (+2)
- **Pattern**: +2 zombies every wave

### Zombie Speed
```javascript
speed = 1 + (wave * 0.1)
```
- **Wave 1**: 1.1 speed
- **Wave 2**: 1.2 speed
- **Wave 3**: 1.3 speed
- **Wave 10**: 2.0 speed (2x faster than Wave 1)
- **Wave 20**: 3.0 speed (3x faster than Wave 1)
- **Pattern**: Linear increase of +0.1 per wave

### Zombie Health (Base)
```javascript
health = (2 + Math.floor(wave / 3)) * 2
```
- **Waves 1-2**: 4 HP (doubled from 2)
- **Waves 3-5**: 6 HP (doubled from 3)
- **Waves 6-8**: 8 HP (doubled from 4)
- **Waves 9-11**: 10 HP (doubled from 5)
- **Waves 12-14**: 12 HP (doubled from 6)
- **Waves 15-17**: 14 HP (doubled from 7)
- **Waves 18-20**: 16 HP (doubled from 8)
- **Waves 21-23**: 18 HP (doubled from 9)
- **Waves 24-26**: 20 HP (doubled from 10)
- **Pattern**: +2 HP every 3 waves (doubled from +1 HP)

**Note**: This is the base health for Normal zombies. Special zombie variants apply multipliers to this base value.

## Special Zombie Types

The game features **6 special zombie variants** that spawn at specific wave thresholds with unique characteristics:

### Normal Zombie
- **Base Type**: Default enemy
- **Health**: Base formula (2 + floor(wave/3))
- **Speed**: Base formula (1 + wave * 0.1)
- **Spawn**: Always available (default when special types don't spawn)

### Fast Zombie (The Runner)
- **Health**: 60% of base (rounded down)
- **Speed**: 1.6x base speed
- **Hitbox**: 80% of normal radius (smaller, harder to hit)
- **Visual**: Reddish/orange appearance with speed trail particles
- **Spawn**: Wave 3+, ~15% chance

- **Visual**: Orange/yellow pulsing glow, faster pulse when low health or close to player
- **Spawn**: Wave 5+, ~10% chance (only if not Fast)
- **Code**: `js/entities/Zombie.js:512-630`

**Example Health by Wave:**
- Wave 5: Base 3 HP → Exploding: 2 HP (80% = 2.4, floored)
- Wave 6: Base 4 HP → Exploding: 3 HP
- Wave 9: Base 5 HP → Exploding: 4 HP

- **Visual**: Toxic green appearance, bloated/swollen look
- **Spawn**: Wave 6+, ~8% chance (only if not Fast/Exploding/Ghost)
- **Code**: `js/entities/Zombie.js:705-864`

### Armored Zombie (The Tank)
- **Health**: Base formula (full health)
- **Speed**: 0.75x base speed (slower)
- **Armor**: 10 + (wave * 1.5) armor points
- **Damage System**: 65% of damage absorbed by armor, 35% leaks through to health
- **Visual**: Metal armor plates overlay, larger silhouette (+2 radius)
- **Spawn**: Wave 3+, scaling chance (10% base + 3% per wave, caps at 50%)
- **Code**: `js/entities/Zombie.js:330-393`

**Armor Examples:**
- Wave 3: 14.5 armor (10 + 3*1.5)
- Wave 6: 19 armor (10 + 6*1.5)
- Wave 10: 25 armor (10 + 10*1.5)
- Wave 20: 40 armor (10 + 20*1.5)

**Effective Health Calculation:**
- Effective HP = Health + (Armor / 0.65)

### Boss Zombie
- **Health**: 500 + (wave * 50) - **massive scaling**
- **Speed**: 0.6 (fixed, slower than normal zombies)
- **Size**: 35 radius (nearly 3x normal size)
- **Special**: Area attack every 3 seconds (120 radius, 20 damage), charges for 1 second before attacking

- Wave 20: 1500 HP (500 + 20*50)
- Wave 25: 1750 HP (500 + 25*50)

## Special Zombie Spawn Rates

The spawn system uses a priority-based random selection:

1. **Fast Zombie**: Wave 3+, 15% chance (0.00-0.15)
2. **Exploding Zombie**: Wave 5+, 10% chance (0.15-0.25) - only if not Fast
3. **Ghost Zombie**: Wave 4+, 10% chance (0.25-0.35) - only if not Fast/Exploding
4. **Spitter Zombie**: Wave 6+, 8% chance (0.35-0.43) - only if not Fast/Exploding/Ghost
5. **Armored Zombie**: Wave 3+, scaling chance (0.35-1.00 range)
   - Base chance: 10% + (wave - 3) * 3%
   - Maximum: 50% (capped)
   - Example: Wave 6 = 10% + (6-3)*3% = 19% chance
   - Example: Wave 15 = 10% + (15-3)*3% = 46% chance (capped at 50%)
6. **Normal Zombie**: Default fallback if no special type spawns

**Code Reference**: `js/main.js:832-858`

- **Waves 6-8**: 4 shots per zombie (getting inefficient)
- **Waves 9-11**: 5 shots per zombie (not recommended)
- **Waves 12+**: 6+ shots per zombie (very inefficient)

**Against Special Types:**
- Fast Zombie: 1-2 shots (60% health)
- Exploding/Ghost/Spitter: 2-4 shots (80% health)
- Armored: 3-10+ shots (depends on armor pool)

- **Waves 3-5**: 1 pellet = kill (efficient)
- **Waves 6-8**: 1-2 pellets = kill (good)
- **Waves 9-11**: 2 pellets = kill (still viable)
- **Waves 12-14**: 2 pellets = kill (ammo intensive)
- **Waves 15+**: 2-3 pellets = kill (very ammo intensive)

**Against Special Types:**
- Fast Zombie: Often 1 pellet (very weak)
- Exploding/Ghost/Spitter: 1 pellet (80% health)
- Armored: 1-3+ pellets (armor absorbs most damage)

### Rifle (4 damage, doubled from 2)
- **Waves 1-2**: 1 shot = kill (very efficient)

- Armored: 2-4+ shots (armor system)

## Difficulty Curve Analysis

### Linear Scaling (Speed & Count)
- **Speed**: Increases smoothly, predictable
- **Count**: Increases smoothly, predictable
- **Result**: Steady, consistent difficulty increase

### Step Scaling (Health)
- **Health**: Jumps every 3 waves
- **Result**: Creates "difficulty spikes" at waves 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.
- **Effect**: These waves feel noticeably harder than the previous wave

### Combined Effect
The combination creates:
- **Smooth baseline increase** (speed + count)
- **Periodic difficulty spikes** (health jumps)
- **Exponential total HP** (count × health = total enemy HP)

## Total Enemy HP Per Wave

| Wave | Total HP | vs Wave 1 |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 10 | 1.0x |
| 5 | 39 | 3.9x |
| 10 | 115 | 11.5x |
| 15 | 198 | 19.8x |
| 20 | 301 | 30.1x |
| 25 | 477 | 47.7x |
| 30 | 756 | 75.6x |
| 35 | 949 | 94.9x |
| 40 | 1245 | 124.5x |
| 50 | 1854 | 185.4x |

**Note**: Total HP scales roughly quadratically due to both count and health increasing.

## Player Resources (Static)

- **Health**: 100 HP (fixed maximum)
- **Health Regeneration**: 1 HP per second when out of combat (no zombie damage for 5 seconds)
- **Health Pickups**: +25 HP every 15 seconds (if below max and health > 0)
- **Ammo**: Weapon-specific, limited per wave
  - Pistol: 10 rounds
  - Shotgun: 5 shells
  - Rifle: 30 rounds
- **No ammo pickups**: Ammo is finite per wave (must manage resources carefully)
- **Grenades**: Limited supply, powerful AOE damage

## Difficulty Balance Observations

### Strengths
✅ **Predictable scaling** - Players can anticipate difficulty
✅ **Multiple scaling factors** - Creates varied challenge
✅ **Health spikes** - Creates memorable difficulty moments
✅ **Speed scaling** - Forces movement skill improvement

### Potential Issues
⚠️ **No player power scaling** - Player doesn't get stronger
⚠️ **Limited resources** - No ammo pickups means resource scarcity
⚠️ **Exponential HP growth** - Late game becomes very difficult
⚠️ **No difficulty plateaus** - Constant increase may feel relentless

## Recommendations for Balance

### Current System Works Well For:
- Short to medium play sessions (waves 1-15)
- Skill-based progression
- High score chasing
- Learning curve

### Could Be Enhanced With:
- Ammo pickups from zombies (resource management)
- Player upgrades/perks (power scaling)
- Difficulty plateaus (waves 20, 30, etc. maintain difficulty)
- More boss variety (different boss types with unique mechanics)
- Health regeneration improvements (faster regen, regen upgrades)

**Note**: Boss waves are already implemented (every 5 waves), and health regeneration exists (1 HP/sec out of combat).
