## 🚀 CURRENT FOCUS: v0.7.1.1 (Small Polish Update)

**Goal:** Quick hotfix and polish pass following the v0.7.1 release. Addressing immediate feedback.

- [ ] **Audio Balance Tweak**:
    - Shotgun sound is slightly too loud compared to BGM. Lower by 10%.
    - Fix rare audio popping when too many zombies die at once (limit max concurrent death sounds?).
- [ ] **Visual Fixes**:
    - "Ammo" text on HUD overlaps with weapon icon on 4:3 resolutions.
    - Add subtle shadow to the crosshair for better visibility on bright backgrounds.
- [ ] **Gameplay Tweak**:
    - Increase "Speed Boost" pickup duration from 10s to 12s (feels a bit too short).
- [ ] **Buff/Debuff Tray** (Roadmap): Visual icons with timers for active status effects.
- [ ] **Impact Decals** (Roadmap): Persistent bullet holes and scorch marks on surfaces.
- [ ] **Distant Ambience** (Roadmap): Background soundscape (distant sirens, wind) for immersion.
- [ ] **Weapon Inspection** (Roadmap): Press 'H' to admire weapon and check ammo.
- [ ] **Fireflies** (Roadmap): Ambient bioluminescence near trees at night.

## 💭 DEV THOUGHTS

- *The particle system is getting heavy. Might need to look into object pooling for particles if we add more explosions.*
- *Players are asking for a "Pause" button on mobile. Need to figure out touch controls eventually.*
- *For v0.8.0, we need to make sure "Scrap" doesn't clutter the screen. Maybe auto-collect or magnetic pickup?*
